# This is a simple bot template you can use to start creating your own Discord bot with discord.py! For help, read the [documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) or ask a question in the [discord.py support server](https://discord.gg/dpy)! Here's how to use this template:

## Step 1
Clone this repository by using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vxsualized/discord-bot-template
```

## Step 2
Install the dependencies by using
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -y
```

## Step 3
Rename the `example.env` to `.env` and paste your bot token that you can get in the "Bot" section after you've created your application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Enable all Privileged Gateway Intents as well.

## Step 4
Use the following command to run the bot
```bash
python3 main.py
```
(This command may vary based on your OS.)
